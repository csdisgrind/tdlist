-> add-role.js 204 & student-profile 20 why no content-type?

ans:
when you are submitting forms, you should not define the content-type,
this is because the size of formData is not consistent, the AJAX req cant be certain how much data it is sending,
this may cause extra space reserved or incomplete data transfer

-> When use body : new FormData(form), JSON.stringify

ans: 
if you are using the form element, and wish to wrap all inputs within the form as one submission. 
FormData is needed, but the server will need to use formidable or other libraries to decode it.
JSON.stringify is simply converting any input to a JSON string, therefore, 
any other type of body data can be sent to the server this way.

My recommendation : 
submitting forms with any files => FormData
the rest => JSON.stringify

-> result.err / result.error
ans: 
this simply depends on what you res.json() in the server
check server.ts try-catch, you used 'err' for this project 

-- server.ts
-> understand why this api needs to match with the form action api

ans : 
the form action is defining the API route to handle its req
